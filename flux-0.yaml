# This is flux v2 pinned at the last v0 update before the v2.0.0 release to
# fulfil a specific request from JAMF to support their upgrade path. All
# components released as part of this tag are also suffixed with `-0.37` to
# indicate they belong as part of the same image commitment.
# Ref: https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.2
#
# Since flux does not backport fixes, this means `flux-0` pins flux at v0.41.2.
# This package will never be updated, and is only kept around long enough to
# fulfil the upgrade path we've promised JAMF since it will accrew CVE's
# indefinitely.
