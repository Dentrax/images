# Chainguard Enterprise Wolfi Packages

This package repository will host all paid packages support by Chainguard but not made available
on [Wolfi](https://wolfi.dev/os).

New package requests are usually submitted as part of a customer request. Please visit
our '[Customer Engagements'](https://wiki.inky.wtf/docs/teams/engineering/images/customer-engagements/) page for more
details.

This repo is owned by the [Images Team](https://wiki.inky.wtf/docs/teams/engineering/images/chainguard-images/).

For help with patching CVEs and recording the associated advisory data, see the ["How To Patch CVEs"](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os/blob/main/HOW_TO_PATCH_CVES.md) documentation in Wolfi.

# Contents

This repository is based on the open source [Wolfi OS repository](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os) with a few differences.

### Add a new package

Tp add a new melange package, create a melange yaml file and make sure you add an entry to the Makefile that matches the `package.name` and `package.version`.

The main difference to Wolfi OS is that we need to specifiy the Wolfi OS repository and keyring so we can fetch dependencies when building.

i.e.

```yaml
environment:
  contents:
    repositories:
      - https://packages.wolfi.dev/os
    keyring:
      - https://packages.wolfi.dev/os/wolfi-signing.rsa.pub
```

Because of this difference, when validating lint locally you need to override two default rules...

```sh
wolfitl lint --skip-rule forbidden-repository-used --skip-rule forbidden-keyring-used
```

## Git Submodules

The Enterprise package repository provides APK packages for paid Chainguard Images.  As a result there are certain cases where the source that is being compiled into APK comes from a private Git location, as an example Chainguard maintains a private fork of [Grafana](https://github.com/chainguard-images/grafana/).

Today, melange does not support auth when fetching from private source Git Repositories.  As a tactical solution for now we are using Git Submodules to add a reference to the private Git repository, when our pipelines checkout the enterprise repo we include the submodules.  When the melange build runs the source is already available in the `--source-dir` for the package, i.e. `./grafana`.

### Adding a Git submodule

The Grafana Submodule was added using...

```sh
git submodule add --depth 1  https://github.com/chainguard-images/grafana.git grafana
```

To add a new Submodule use the example above, ensuring the target directory matches the melange package name.

Once done make sure the `.gitmodules` file contains the correct repo and path.  It is good practice to also add a `branch:` field that matches a tag to the commit in the submodule.

### Auto updates

Using Git Submodules can cause some pain.  For this reason we have built some automation to keep these submodules up to date.  Continuing with the Grafana example, when a merge to the main branch is performed there is a GitHub Action that creates a new version based on previous Git Tags, creates a new GitHub Release and upgrades this Enterprise Git Repository via Pull Request.

[This is the GitHub Action](https://github.com/chainguard-images/grafana/blob/2679925fb0a0a27e6ff4aef94fd011955f3e969c/.github/workflows/cg-release.yaml#L25-L44) that does this automation, built with `wolfictl`.  You should be able to copy the same Action into your new fork when adding another.

The `wolfictl update package` command will update the `.gitmodules` file as well as fetching the corresponding commit reference which in effect triggers an upgrade via automated GitHub Pull Request.

Additionally, when working on a fork, if you fix a CVE make sure to include a `fixes: CVE2023-1234` commit comment.  The generated Pull Request on the Enterprise repo will include auto generated advisory fix information and secfixes updates, for the fixed CVE.

### Manual updates

Modify `.gitmodules` to update the version

```
git submodule update
cd grafana
git pull
cd ..
git add | commit | push
```

## Sub repositories

There are situations where we need a new Enterprise repository.  One example is to support OpenSSL 1.  In this case we don't want to mix and match apks built with different OpenSSL versions.  Rather than duplicating Git repos, infrastructure and maintenance overheads we are able to add sub folders to this Enterprise Git repo that result in their own package repositories.

An important note is these sub package repos are signed with the same chainguard enterprise signing key and share the same build infrastructure.

### Adding a sub package repository

When adding a new sub repo, choose a name `sub-os-$DESCRIPTIVE_NAME`.  You will also need to copy

```
./github/workflows/ci-build-os-openssl1.yaml
./github/workflows/wolfictl-lint-os-openssl1.yaml
./github/workflows/dag-push-enterprise-os-openssl1.yaml
```

Rename the suffix and search / replace `openssl1` to match your descriptive name.

The names of the GitHub Actions must be the same to ensure required checks pass before merging Pull Requests

Note, when creating new CI checks to test them you will need to use

```yaml
on:
 pull_request:
```

Push to a branch on the main Enterprise repo and create a Pull Request from there.  Once everything is verified and working, follow up a PR to switch to

```yaml
on:
 pull_request_target:
```

This is a security measure when secrets are used in CI checks.  Modified CI Actions via Pull Requests from forks will have no effect.  They need to use `pull_request` and be created from a branch not fork.

### Using a sub package repository

To use a sub package repository when building more apks or images via apko you can fetch the sub repo bucket and configure the `environment.contents.repository` and `environment.contents.keyring` sections of your melange or apko yaml files.

#### Example:

Create a clean folder

```sh
mkdir ent-test
cd ent-test
```

Fetch the enterprise bucket locally
```sh
mkdir ent
gsutil -m rsync -r gs://chainguard-enterprise-registry-destination/os/ "./ent/"
```

Create a melange config file called, e.g. `foo.melange.yaml`  and copy this into it

```yaml
package:
 name: foo
 version: 1.2.3
 epoch: 0
 description: foo test
 target-architecture:
   - all
 copyright:
   - license: Apache-2.0
     paths:
       - "*"

environment:
 contents:
   repositories:
     - https://packages.wolfi.dev/os
     - /work/ent
     - /work/ent/sub-os-openssl1
   keyring:
     - https://packages.wolfi.dev/os/wolfi-signing.rsa.pub
     - /work/ent/chainguard-enterprise.rsa.pub
   packages:
     - busybox
     - grafana
     - openssl-1.1

pipeline:
 - runs: |
     mkdir -p ${{targets.destdir}}/usr
     echo test > ${{targets.destdir}}/usr/tester
```

That contains three repos
- wolfi
- enterprise
- enterprise sub repo for openssl

and an extra keyring which was used to sign both enterprise and enterprise sub repo apks

Now build

```sh
docker run --platform linux/aarch64 --privileged -v "$PWD":/work -w /work cgr.dev/chainguard/melange build foo.melange.yaml --arch aarch64
```

You can now extend this to build your own apks using whichever private enterprise bucket you need.
