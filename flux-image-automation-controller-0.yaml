# Flux contains multiple components that are released together as a package of
# individually versioned components with no logical mapping between them.
# The versioning stream suffixed to this package name (-0) indicates the
# flux version of this component. The component versions can be found here:
# Ref: https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/releases/tag/v0.41.2
#
# This package exists as a commitment to JAMF to support their upgrade path,
# and should never be updated. It is only kept around long enough to fulfill
# said upgrade path we agreed to.
